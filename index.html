            <p class="lead">
              <!-- blog post text -->
              <p>During my childhood, I grew up playing with dolls, looking after & pushing them around in a pram, dreaming of the day I would be old enough to become a nurse or be looking after young children, helping them to grow and enjoy their early years, whilst developing their young minds.
When I left school at 18, with good GCSEs and A-levels and by the time I'd left, I was already working, with a regular supermarket job in the day, and a bar job in the evening, whilst I studied to become qualified in working with children.</p>
              <p>At age 20, I had to put my studies on hold, as I became a mum myself, to a wonderful daughter called Poppy. (She is 10 now - how time flies!) and by the time i had settled into motherhood, battling the school run every morning, i had my second child, a son called Isaac (or Whirlwind as we like to call him!)</p>
              <p>After going through motherhood again, from the very beginning, I resumed my Childhood studies, luckily i had completed my level 2 certificate before i’d had my daughter, so i could go on to level 3 with confidence, Trust me when i say juggling an education and children is definitely not easy! - Not by a long shot! But after 18 months I had finally completed my studies.
Fast forward 5 years, i was 28 - in the prime of my career, i was a Room leader for ages 3-5 year olds, had two wonderful children, so why did i feel complacent? Like I was missing something?</p>
              <p>That’s because i was, i was missing the challenge, the get up in the morning, and the chance to add my own ideas, and artistic flare to something i had created, and was able to proudly showcase to lots of people, who were also able to contribute their own idea/take on projects, allowing me to see things from a different perspective. The difference been, that in Childcare you need the knowledge to be able to follow the educational framework & teach children, as rewarding as this was. I found myself craving challenges on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>As i researched Technology and Web Development regularly in the evenings initially, from the second i finally managed to sit down in the evening, i found myself becoming drawn more and more to it, as i signed up to web development sites, and began taking part in challenges and tutorials set by tutors and experts, I knew this is the sector where i could discover the challenges i needed to engage my brain, getting me thinking about the 3 W’s:  What I would be learning next, Where could i use my newly learned skills, and When was the right time to put them into practice. In Autumn, I am beginning a Computer Science degree.</p>
              <p>I ended up leaving the job i thought was my dream one, to take myself down another career path, where my mind and decision making were being challenged almost daily, i made new friends on LinkedIn and Twitter, who were always on hand to help out with any questions when i had days where i felt like giving up, you may be familiar with those, you know, when that code you thought was right, returns a “Syntax Error”, or your console doesn't display the message you thought it would, and you spend all day looking at it, to discover 50 lines up you forgot to close a <code>&gt;div&lt;</code> tag. Yes, those kinds of days.</p>
              <p>I soon discovered that everyone, however experienced they were, are all on the same journey. We are all here to help and support each other along the way. </p>
              <p>If anyone says learning code and various platforms to execute it is easy, they are lying to you..
But is Learning Web development, and becoming an engineer achievable? Absolutely! </p>
