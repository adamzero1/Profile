              <h2><u>Growing up</u></h2>
              <br />
              <p>During my childhood, I grew up playing with dolls, looking after & pushing them around in a pram, dreaming of the day I would be old enough to become a nurse or be looking after young children, helping them to grow and enjoy their early years, whilst developing their young minds.
When I left school at 18, with good GCSEs and A-levels and by the time I'd left, I was already working, with a regular supermarket job in the day, and a bar job in the evening, whilst I studied to become qualified in working with children.</p>
              <p>At age 20, I had to put my studies on hold, as I became a mum myself, to a wonderful daughter called Poppy. (She is 10 now - how time flies!) and by the time i had settled into motherhood, battling the school run every morning, i had my second child, a son called Isaac (or Whirlwind as we like to call him!)</p>
              <p>After going through motherhood from the very beginning with Isaac, I resumed my Childhood studies, luckily I had completed my level 2 certificate before I'd had my daughter, so I could go on to level 3 with confidence, Trust me when I say juggling an education and children is definitely not easy! - Not by a long shot! But after 18 months I had finally completed my studies. </p>
              <br>
              <h2><u>Craving the challenge</u></h2>
Fast forward to 5 years later, I had just turned 28 and was in the prime of my career, a Room leader for 3-5 year olds, and I had two wonderful children, so why did I feel complacent in my dream career, and Like I was missing something?</p>
              <p>That’s because I was, I was lacking the challenge, the get up in the morning, and the chance to add my own ideas, and artistic flare to something I had created, and that I was able to proudly showcase to lots of people, who were also, in turn, able to contribute their own ideas or take on projects, allowing me to see things from a different perspective. The difference being, that in Childcare you need the knowledge to be able to follow the educational framework & teach children, as rewarding as this was. I found myself craving challenges on a daily basis.</p>
              <br />
              <h2><u>Where do I start first?</u></h2>
              <p>I first began looking up Technology and Web based Development in small doses initially, maybe 1 or 2 hours in the evening. I used to begin researching from the second I managed to sit down at the end of the day, and I found myself becoming more and more drawn to it. I began signing up to web development learning sites, and taking part in challenges and tutorials set by tutors and experts. I knew this is the sector where i could discover the challenges and problem solving I craved and needed to engage my brain. I find myself daily thinking about the 3 W’s:  What I will I be learning next? Where could I use my newly learned skills? and when was the right time to put them into practice? This Autumn, I am beginning a Computer Science degree, to coinside</p>
              <br />
              <h2><u>Social links & networking</u></h2>
              <p>My mind and decision making are being challenged almost daily, I have made new friends on LinkedIn and Twitter, who are always on hand to help out with any questions that I may have, when I have days where i feel like giving up, You may be familiar with those kind of days, you know,the ones when that code you thought was right, returns a “Syntax Error”, or your console doesn't display the message you thought it would, and you spend all day looking at it,only to discover 50 lines up you forgot to close a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag. Yes, those kinds of days.</p>
              <p>I have soon discovered that everyone, however experienced they are, were all on the same journey, and We are all here to help and support each other along the way. </p>
              <p>If anyone says learning code and various platforms to execute it is easy, they are lying to you..
But is Learning Web development, and becoming an engineer achievable? Absolutely! </p>
